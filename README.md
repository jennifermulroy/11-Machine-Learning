# Applying Machine-Learning Models to Predict Credit Risk 

In this assignment, several machine-learning models were used to predict credit risk using free data from LendingClub. The algorithms were selected to address the inherently imbalanced classification problem of credit risk.

1. Naive Random Oversampler and SMOTE algorithms to oversample the data 
2. Cluster Centroids algorithm to undersample the data 
3. SMOTEENN algorithm to over and under-sample the data 

For each algorithm, a logistic regression classifier from sklearn.linear_model was used to resample the data. A balanced accuracy score, confusion matrix, and imbalanced classification report was generated. 

> Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
> Which model had the best recall score?
> Which model had the best geometric mean score?
